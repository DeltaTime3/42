Assignment name  : sandbox  
Expected files   : sandbox.c  
Allowed functions: fork, waitpid, exit, alarm, sigaction, kill, printf, strsignal, errno  

================================================================================

Write the following function:

```c
#include <stdbool.h>
int sandbox(void (*f)(void), unsigned int timeout, bool verbose);
```

This function must test if the function `f` is a nice function or a bad function.  
- You must return `1` if `f` is nice, `0` if `f` is bad, or `-1` in case of an error in your function.

A function is considered **bad** if:
- It is terminated or stopped by a signal (segfault, abort, etc.).
- It exits with any code other than `0`.
- It times out.

If `verbose` is `true`, you must write the appropriate message among the following:

- `"Nice function!\n"`
- `"Bad function: exited with code <exit_code>\n"`
- `"Bad function: <signal description>\n"`
- `"Bad function: timed out after <timeout> seconds\n"`

Process management:

- You must not leak processes (even in zombie state, this will be checked using `wait`).

Note:

- Your code will be tested with very bad functions.
